# Project Name

## Database Setup

1. Install Node.js and MongoDB on your machine.
2. Create a MongoDB database and replace the `databaseUrl` in `config.js` with your connection string.
3. Run the following commands in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install
   node initDatabase.js

### Step 4: Running the Scripts

1. Make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine.
2. Run `npm install` in your project directory to install dependencies.
3. Run `node initDatabase.js` to initialize the database.

This example assumes a Node.js environment with the `mongoose` library for MongoDB. Adjust the code according to your specific tech stack and database system.

Remember, this is a basic example, and in a real-world application, you might want to handle errors more gracefully, provide more configuration options, and possibly use a database migration tool for more complex scenarios.
